                Hello,

                Thank you for using Overlord! This bot is a serious passion project of mine that has truly ignited me to learn and create something that, hopefully, can be of benefit to the Discord community – and if not, at the very least it is something I found a lot of enjoyment in developing.
                 
                Overlord was created because, while I understand there are many amazing security Discord bots out there, as an AI engineer early in my career, I have often thought of how I can aspire to create an innovative application leveraging machine learning as a dynamic solution to a dynamic problem. Countless times, I have found scammers and spammers in Discord servers taking advantage of people publicly in Discord servers; the audacity has gone along far too long. Welcome to world of Overlord.
                
                While I look to provide a quality application, I would also like to lay out some terms of use for the sake of keeping the Overlord project strong and well.

We do have SQL support for our bot to directly track spam, but none of this data is ever collected by The Overlord Team and users invoking this feature must let their server population(s) know in accordance with Discord policy; we are not responsible for servers utilizing this functionality and logging your spam data, but please note The Overlord Team itself will NEVER take your personal data and does not have access to any data logged through the SQL support feature..*

Use of Overlord for malicious intent is completely prohibited and may result in The Overlord Team sanctioning your access to the program.
